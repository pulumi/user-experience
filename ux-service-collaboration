# UX Team + Service Team Collaboration

## PRs in the Service Repo
- when opening a pr in the service repo, always add Chris, Devon, Jamie, and Steve as reviewers and post in the #pulumi-service channel
- the person opening the pr is responsible for addressing/responding to comments and merging once they have at least one approval from
a reviewer who has "sufficient context in a given area"
