### Team Meetings

These are meant to be informal. We come together and chat about anything we'd like, work realted or not.
This meeting style is inspire by [Honeycomb's approach](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/standup-meetings-are-dead/).

### Iteration Planning

- Before the start of the meeting everyone should review the backlog and ready columns and move things
up to the top that are high impact or that folks have interest in working on the next iteration

#### General Structure

- Celebrate what was completed the last milestone
- Move anything started but unfinished to the next milestone
- A quick review of quarter epics and progress
- Discuss anything not-started from the last iteration and decided whether to move it to the next milestone
- Remove milestone filter and together add what we want to accomplish this milestone

## Retro

- We get together and add cards to the board in two categories: "What went well", "What could be better", then together as a group we talk about them
- Everything is welcome for discussion including things that are happening outside of our team
