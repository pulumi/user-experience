## Back-cover Blurb

Hi! I’m Anita and I joined Pulumi as a UX Designer in January 2022. 

I’m a Pittsburgh, PA native with no intention of leaving. If you ask me about our sports teams, I’m afraid I won’t know anything. A few things I _can_ fill a conversation about:
1. writing 
2. photography 
3. sci-fi film & television 
4. food 
5. cats

Pulumi is my first full-time foray into UX. Before this, I was a professional newborn photographer. I also have a BA in fiction writing and am still active in the literary community online. 

## Working Together

I‘m always free to talk and love 1:1s and small group conversations. So If I forgot to respond to your message, I accidentally cleared my notifications and you should definitely ping me again. 

I prioritize clarity and deliberateness in all my UX  work. In groups, I play flexibly to keep the team wheels greased. I can always change things up in my process or communication style if it's helpful to someone else!
